Observation: Chemistry:
In 10th grade Chemistry, students will explore the fundamental principles of the physical and chemical properties of matter. They will learn about the periodic table, chemical reactions, and atomic structure. Students will be introduced to laboratory techniques and safety procedures and perform experiments to reinforce theoretical concepts. The course will also focus on real-world applications of chemistry in fields such as medicine, environmental science, and engineering. By the end of the course, students will have a strong foundation in chemistry that will enable them to pursue further study in the field.

Mathematics:
In 10th grade Mathematics, students will build upon the concepts learned in previous years and dive deeper into algebra, geometry, and trigonometry. They will learn how to solve equations, factor polynomials, and apply trigonometric functions. Students will also explore data analysis, probability, and statistics, as well as apply mathematical modeling to real-world problems. The course will emphasize critical thinking, problem-solving, and logical reasoning skills, and will provide students with the tools to succeed in higher-level mathematics courses.

Physical Education:
In 10th grade Physical Education, students will engage in a variety of activities designed to promote physical fitness, teamwork, and sportsmanship. Students will participate in individual and team sports, strength and conditioning exercises, and outdoor activities such as hiking and biking. The course will also focus on the importance of proper nutrition and healthy lifestyle choices. By the end of the course, students will have developed a greater appreciation for physical activity and the benefits it can have on both their physical and mental well-being.

Foreign Language:
In 10th grade Foreign Language, students will continue to develop their proficiency in a foreign language. They will build upon the basic vocabulary and grammar learned in previous years and begin to explore more complex linguistic concepts. Students will practice listening, speaking, reading, and writing skills, and engage in conversations and activities that simulate real-life situations. The course will also provide cultural context and encourage students to appreciate the diversity and richness of other cultures.

Art:
In 10th grade Art, students will explore a variety of media and techniques to express themselves creatively. They will learn about the elements of art and principles of design, as well as explore different styles and movements in art history.
